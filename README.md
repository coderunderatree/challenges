# About
This is a NodeJs app which helps us to store and add Patient info.

# Usage
- The home page shows all the data stored in our database.
- It also has a form page which can be used to enter patient data. The data entered is validated by a module "express-validator",
and we are redirected to an errors page if there are any errors.

# Technologies used
- NodeJs for backend.
- Non relational database MongoDB. MongoLab for storing data in database.
- Heroku for deploying the [app](https://challenge-dataphi.herokuapp.com/patients).
